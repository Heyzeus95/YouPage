            I'm learning how to write code. We recently learned the basics on how to write html code. 
        I was born on june 13,1995. I was born and raised in Chicago. I have lived here all of my life but I
        back to Mexico every year to visit my family that lives over there. My family migrated from Mexico in 
        the late 80s and 90s. My family is from the state of Michoacan in Mexico. I enjoy frequently going back
        to Mexico because I feel calm and relaxed when i'm over there.

            I went to a golf course earlier this week with the rest of my colleagues. Every person was given a 
        job or task that they had to be doing during the day to help out with the event. I was station at the 
        beginning of the course and had to oversee a small game that they had. The players had 3 shots to make it
        into the hole. the player who made it into the cup would be the winner, if not it would be the player that 
        made it closest to the hole. My job was to measure out where the ball landed and wrote down how far each 
        players ball was from the cup. Anthony was also there to help with this task. Out of all the people who 
        played, only 2 people made the ball into the cup. Eventually the event got cancelled because it started to
        rain. Even though the event eventually got cancelled I still had a great time at the outing and hope we do
        something similar again.

            Some of my hobbies include riding a bicycle, traveling to different places, and playing a wide
        variety of video games. Before I was able to buy my first car I traveled everywhere on my bike. Since 
        I live in the city, I can get to almost any place I want to go on my bike. Since I didnt have a car yet
        but I still wanted to go to different places with my friends and family the best option would be going on
        bike. Another hobby that I have is traveling to different places.
